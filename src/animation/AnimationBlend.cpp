// AnimationBlend implementation is now provided by the generic PoseBlend functions.
// BonePose/SkeletonPose are type aliases to NodePose/HierarchyPose.
// All AnimationBlend namespace functions are inline delegates in the header.
// This file is kept for build system compatibility.

// No additional implementation needed - all functions are inline delegates.
